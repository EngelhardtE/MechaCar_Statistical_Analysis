## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- There is a non-random amount of variance within the following: vehicle_weight, vehicle_length, and ground clearance.
- THe slope of the linear regression is not zero because the p-value is equal to 5.35 x 10^(-11), which is less than the 0.05% significance level.
- Based on the multiple R-squared (about 71.5%), the linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
